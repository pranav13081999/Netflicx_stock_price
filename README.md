# Netflix-stock-price-prediction-using-LSTM-model

Preprocessed historical stock price data, including cleaning, normalization, and featureengineering, to enhance model performance.
Implemented the LSTM model, a type of RNN, to capture temporal dependencies andpatterns in the stock price time series data. 
Conducted thorough hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance,achieving a balance between accuracy and generalization.
